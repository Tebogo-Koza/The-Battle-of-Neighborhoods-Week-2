    "\n",
    "The purpose of the the report is to help people and business people to discern and establish the rental property range and significant venues(restaurants and shops), aceesible in New York, if they so wish to move there.\n",
    "This will be done so by segmenting and clustering neighborhoods in different Boroughs of New York. And thus help those who want to migrate locally know more about the competing businesses that are active there, or those from outside to have a better understanding of the Geography of the state of New York.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Section\n",

    "https://cocl.us/new_york/dataset\n",
    "http://local*t Borroughs of New York, and the average price ranges, using sklearn tools, and applying geocoder to futher support the Foursquare API. \n",

    "The rental Properties vary. They cater for low income, middle income, and high income persons/families.\n",
    "The Borroughs are relativley similar: Bronx, Manhattan and Queens.\n",
